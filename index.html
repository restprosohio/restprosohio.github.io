    <h3>What People Say About Us</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have had Restoration Professionals perform a number of jobs for me, from repairs to full room tear outs and rebuilds. Without fail the work has been exceptional and the workers courteous, knowledgeable and efficient. When our house was broken into after we moved out and before the property sold, Eric and crew were able to go to the house, secure the location and give me an itemized list of damages along with assurances that the damage could be repaired within a reasonable time. I would definitely recommend Restoration Professionals.</p>
      <p>~SJ, Dayton, OH</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank you! We didn't know what to do when our lower level flooded but you came immediately when we called and handled everything, even dealing with our insurance company! The repairs were done so well and we couldn't be happier with the results! We would definitely recommend you to anyone we know!</p>
